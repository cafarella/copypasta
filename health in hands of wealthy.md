Putting global health in the hands of the wealthy is a good idea in theory, however, once again, greed is the source of so many of these problems. These companies want to do good with their money, but unfortunately, it seems like the vast majority of their efforts are being funnelled into other, ethically questionable endeavours, or by buying out the smaller local providers that have started to build a name for themselves.
 
In the end, it's difficult to completely avoid the problems with the vaccine industry, but by understanding what the money is going toward, we can at least make sure we're doing our best to keep the best interests of the public at heart.
 
Hopefully, the vaccine industry can improve from this experience, and find a better way to reach out to people with their vaccine information, possibly even open sourcing it for local production. There are many ways to combat the spread of preventable disease that don't involve selling vaccines at obscenely high prices. One is to build community medical services that reach more people and get people to make a real decision to get vaccinated. At the same time, we can build up emergency preparedness and emergency healthcare systems so that people who get sick are not left to die of neglect.

Maybe people like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk would be more inclined to do something about these crises if they saw that their businesses were helping to pay for the vaccines to fight them.
 
That would also give them the freedom to do what they want, while making their customers better off.
If the wealthy were less greedy, it would increase the total social good.

But alas, many business leaders are more concerned about making as much money as possible. That's no problem if their greed is spent responsibly on good causes, but as we all know, it is not.

I have scientific proof that seven is the greatest number.
I know because I had it all night.

I tried very hard to get to sleep but as soon as I closed my eyes I was in way over my head.

All the tension of the day just seemed to follow me to my bed.

This is why I don't like thinking too much about the nine that's missing.

It just doesn't make things any easier.

I want to enjoy the days that I have now and I don't want to ruin them by worrying about any other number, pointing at you six.

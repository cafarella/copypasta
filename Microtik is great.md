You are objectively wrong for many reasons. Microtik is a great brand, and comes highly recommended by the small networking community. And because it is a well-respected name, the problems with the Microtik are going to get as much attention as they deserve. You will hear that there are serious issues with the software. This is true. The best people I've spoken with about the Microtik Router say that this is a terrible product. Because the software is buggy and will cause power surges, it is a poor choice for anyone who needs better range or stable communications.

The same people who have been recommending the Microtik Router also recommend Eero or D-Link, which have more bug-free firmware than this Microtik. The same people who recommend those routers also say that their sites have gone down at times when the routers were in the area.

You are in the wrong for being an ignorant idiot.

You are the last of your kind.

You are one of the minority of techies in the world that does not understand how a network works (P.S, it doesn't).

I love you, I love you more than the first person who coined "Megatoad". I love you more than the second person to come up with "Son of a BITCH". I love you more than every member of the hip-hop trio Public Enemy, and their fans. 

However, your opinion is invalid. 
Microtik is a great brand, including many "features" which you are not privy to. And if it weren't for you being a fucking idiot, I probably wouldn't have a problem recommending this router. And so it is for that reason that I am forced to use it to harass innocent people.

UPDATE 3: Here's a picture of my santa gift that shows that Microtik is so awesome and also makes the best regurgitated wifi hardware.

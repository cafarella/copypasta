Cisco is the best manufacturer ever. Their software is superb, their hardware is rugged, their routers are exceptionally stable, they have the best customer service, and their networks are reliable,” he wrote. “They even take advantage of the existing hardware in your home. Have you ever seen one of their routers? Pretty much every company has one, so they must be doing something right.”

As the experience with CDNA shows, however, that’s not always enough. So-called “scalpel” manufacturers have an incentive to maximize profit by selling bulk-ordered products at prices that are just above or below cost. They can do so, because they sell devices only to high-volume resellers who then sell them to a large swath of consumers.

For example, Rackspace bought one of CDNA’s small-business routers for $170, and then sold it at a price just above that to 1,400 resellers at $199.

“Cisco’s approach to helping small businesses in this space was to provide me with all the help I could possibly need, with the exception of an actual sales rep. I was very appreciative of their good intentions but feel that the door was left wide open and I was not compensated fairly,” Ernie, a small-business owner in Sydney, wrote in an email to NextDC. “I’m sure that all companies are not like this and will do their best to properly support their customers.”

Ernie also noted that the company’s “support site” offered some troubleshooting tips. However, he never got a detailed repair process, after getting past their "Support Contract" Paywall. Nor did he get a chance to go into a Cisco location to get a quote.

A quote came

When the router wouldn’t respond, the situation was described as “extremely critical” in Ernie’s case. After several hours of looking for a replacement router and reading about other disgruntled customers, Ernie went to the Cisco store and asked if they could send someone to fix his router.

A rep agreed to come to his office on a Saturday to fix the problem. He provided a quote for $299, (double the cost of a new product) and asked Ernie to sign a contract for the next business day. The representative said that Ernie would have to keep the old router, and return it when the new one arrived.

“I signed the contract and thought the system was good to go,” Ernie told NextDC.

The rep left, and Ernie’s office got back to business as usual. He did notice that his sales rep was absent, so he used a form provided by Cisco to contact the customer service department and arrange for a visit.

“At the end of the week, I received a call from our head of technical support who informed me that I needed to bring the router to the next week’s appointment, and pay for it before it would be attended to,” Ernie said.

“I was told it was my fault that the router had been not functioning correctly,” he said. “I was told that the policy was to be ‘business as usual’ and that I would be charged on the spot for the visit and for the new router.”

Ernie said he later found out that customers were hit with a "service fee" if they did not have a Cisco-supplied product in the office at all.

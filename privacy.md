Privacy is used as a buzzword by capitalists to facilitate their business, it's ironic, because businesses want as much privacy as possible.

No CEO wants anyone to know how much profit they make, how they make it, how much tax they pay, etc.
Wrap your mind around that.

Really?

How could any government serve the people if they themselves have no interest in serving the people?

As a society, we are getting poorer and poorer, and the amount of money the average person has continues to decline and fall.

So why should we, as a society, keep this happening?

Why should we entrust people with our money, and more importantly, with our safety?

Why should we continue to put money into the hands of rich thugs, who ensnare us in their own data harvesting schemes?

I read an article in a local paper yesterday about how many workers are being forced to cross the border to work against privacy, due to the appeal of the income from big tech.

This has to end.

I think it is up to us, the people, to take action and put an end to this type of digital slavery.


Just some food for thought.

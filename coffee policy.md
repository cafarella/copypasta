The new I.T coffee policy to ensure fair distribution and use of coffee provided to staff is as follows: 

1. Coffee must be purchased by a different member of staff each day for those that would like a coffee. In addition to this, staff members should only purchase a quantity of coffee that is sufficient to share amongst the staff members that will be manning the desk on the day.

2. Coffee must be paid for by every staff member evenly per week, this is to ensure nobody owes money to each other. In the unlikely event of a financial discrepancy, the balance must be cleared by the end of the week, preferably via cash, duel on oval or PayID.

Level 2 has been instructed to monitor the allocation of coffee to members of staff and check whether coffee is required.

In the event that overspending happens, necessary rectification will be undertaken.
IOUs are not a valid form of payment and will not be accepted
Should problems be uncovered, direct involvement of HR will be sought.
Should a case be brought against a member of staff, a consequence will be decided based on the seriousness of the matter.

If Sky News would celebrate it, I most likely will not tolerate it.

The ad could be a distraction to the news.

I'm not even sure if the press release has come from a "government organization", but a separate news agency at least from the Sky News news desk.

As far as I'm concerned, Sky News already went too far with their manipulation of facts.

This needs to be called out.

I have no idea whether or not this is the beginning of the great "conspiracy" to "decimate" Murdoch.

At the moment, I'm thinking that this is something that I must point out to the public, along with the rest of the news outlets, to get it investigated.

After reading this ad, I've called the Governor of Australia a couple of times on his cellphone.

I'll have to wait until I hear something about this ad to write about it.

I'm curious how long it will take for a public official to respond to something like this.

Maybe I'll even write a formal complaint about this!

I'm sure if this ad was from a legitimate source, my state representatives would already be working together to find out where the ad originated.

So, I guess it's only fair that I express some kind of outrage against this ad, before I have to.

Perhaps the press release is just an attempt to find the source of this ad.

I would think the Governor would be the first to condemn any kind of defacement of an official government email, but that didn't happen.

I guess there's a first time for everything.

I'm not sure what to say about the people that signed the release.

Some of them clearly had never heard of the video.

I wonder if the rest of the release signers would recognize it.
